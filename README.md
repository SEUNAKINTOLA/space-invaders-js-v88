## Architecture

### Game Engine

The game engine is built with modularity in mind:
- `GameEngine`: Core game loop and state management
- `Canvas`: Rendering system
- `Sprite`: Game object representation
- `CollisionSystem`: Handles object interactions
- `QuadTree`: Optimized collision detection

Detailed documentation available in `docs/engine.md` and `docs/collision.md`.

### Configuration

Game settings and engine configuration can be modified in:
- `src/config/engine.js`
- `src/config/collision.js`
