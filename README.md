## Project Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Game Engine** (`src/engine/`)
   - Manages game loop and state
   - Handles rendering and updates
   - Controls game timing

2. **Entity System** (`src/entities/`)
   - Player management
   - Enemy management
   - Collision detection

3. **Systems** (`src/systems/`)
   - Audio management
   - Score tracking
   - Wave generation

4. **Input Management** (`src/engine/InputManager.js`)
   - Keyboard controls
   - Event handling

### Design Patterns

- **Component Pattern**: Used for game objects
- **Observer Pattern**: For event handling
- **State Pattern**: Game state management
- **Factory Pattern**: Entity creation
- **Command Pattern**: Input handling

## Development Guidelines

- Follow ESLint configuration
- Write tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Follow semantic versioning
- Use conventional commits

## Performance Considerations
