Performance Considerations
-----------------------

1. Spatial Partitioning
   - QuadTree reduces collision checks from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n)
   - Dynamic subdivision based on object density
   - Automatic rebalancing during updates

2. Broad Phase
   - Initial collision culling using QuadTree
   - Eliminates distant objects from detailed checks
   - Maintains 60 FPS with up to 1000 objects

3. Narrow Phase
   - AABB collision detection for final checks
   - Optimized for rectangular hitboxes
   - Sub-millisecond performance per check

Memory Management
---------------

1. Object Pooling
   - Reuses collision objects to reduce GC pressure
   - Pre-allocates common collision shapes
   - Maintains stable memory footprint

2. QuadTree Optimization
   - Clears and rebuilds each frame
   - Prevents memory leaks from object references
   - Optimizes for dynamic object movement

Collision Response System
----------------------

1. Event-Based Handling
   - Emits collision events to registered listeners
   - Supports multiple collision response types
   - Allows custom collision handling logic

2. Response Types:
   - Elastic: Objects bounce off each other
   - Inelastic: Objects stop at collision
   - Trigger: No physical response, event only
   - Custom: User-defined behavior
